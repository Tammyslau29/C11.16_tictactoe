# Global Thermonuclear War
This is a variation on the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game based on the movie WarGames. It features a pre-game, terminal-like landing page that uses graphics and audio from the movie to transport the player back in time.  If the user has a Leap Motion Controller, they can use that to activate the time machine and begin the game.  

This game was developed during a 2-day hackathon in a team of three developers-
* Sloan Tash
* Tammy S. Lau
* Michael Justo

## Motivation
This game served as a fantastic exploration of DOM creation and manipulation using jQuery. Though there are many different 'pages', we dynamically created and destroyed the DOM to avoid ever loading a new page. We used bitwise math to detemine the win conditions and included easter eggs to try to breath life into this classic game.

## Technologies Used

* Javascript
* jQuery
* HTML5 / CSS3
